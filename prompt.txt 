Ok, now these are the requirements ;

1. I want the initial demo to take the invoice details from the downloaded invoices, and store them in the sqllite db.
2. I want these details to be put the in the initial email, like we are doing in our current process.
3. Upon recieving the email with the invoices attached, I want the agent to go through the email and check which invoices 
    and which invoices are not recieved, then the reply should be drafted, about the invoices that are missing.


    The most important thing here is that we do not repeat asking for the same invoice again.
